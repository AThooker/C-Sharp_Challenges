             Generate a three-digit lottery number. The program prompts the user to enter a three-digit number and determines whether the user wins according to the following rules:
                1) If the user input matches the lottery number in the exact order, the award is $10,000.
                
                2) If all the digits in the user input match all the digits in the lottery number, the award is $3,000.

                3) If one digit in the user input matches a digit in the lottery number, the award is $1000.

            User should only win one prize (granted they meet one of the rules) so if they meet the $10,000 rule then that's it or if they win the $3,000 that's it as well.
