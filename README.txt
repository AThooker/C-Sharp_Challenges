Sobering Seth's Trials and Tribulations

There will be three levels of challenges that you will complete in order. Gradually getting more and more difficult. 
These challenges are going to combine the things you've learned in the last week.

The key to really learning programming is to actually DO IT and not just watch videos and read about it.

"Talk is cheap. Show me the code." -Linus Torvalds

This is one of my favorite quotes in Computer Science. It's easy to talk about how great a piece of software can be and how it should function, but you will shocked about how much work it takes to actually implement the solution vs the work of designing it and just thinking of it conceptually . So going from conceptualizing ->  Functional program.

My pedagogical notes for you all is:

TLDR Think before you code.
1) For each problem (idc how easy the problem is) I want you to carefully analyze the problem requirements and design strategies for solving the problem before you even type a single line of code. This could be a flow chart or pseudo code. I want you to think about potential pitfalls and ways you could add extra functionality as you are going through these. First solve the problem at hand (MVP) shoot for the minimal viable product. Bascially make sure it works before you try anything fancy.

TLDR Learn from your mistakes.
2) Before you ask for help, read and explain the program to yourself or a team member, and trace it using several representative inputs by hand or using break points. You learn how to program by debugging your own mistakes.
